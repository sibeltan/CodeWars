    "### 14. Weight for weight\n",
    "\n",
    "My friend John and I are members of the \"Fat to Fit Club (FFC)\". John is worried because each month a list with the weights of members is published and each month he is the last on the list which means he is the heaviest.\n",
    "I am the one who establishes the list so I told him: \"Don't worry any more, I will modify the order of the list\". It was decided to attribute a \"weight\" to numbers. The weight of a number will be from now on the sum of its digits.\n",
    "For example 99 will have \"weight\" 18, 100 will have \"weight\" 1 so in the list 100 will come before 99. Given a string with the weights of FFC members in normal order can you give this string ordered by \"weights\" of these numbers?"
